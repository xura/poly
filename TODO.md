- [ ] Some system for centralized dependency management that stores the deps in the poly-config.js, but compares those deps when building for production and raises flags saying "you have updated a shared dep, is this something you want to do?" And this would also go for versions of "main" projects. Like "data@v2 depends on components@v3, but data@v2 does not have this version, please fix"
